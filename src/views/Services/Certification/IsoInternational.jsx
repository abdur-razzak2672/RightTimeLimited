                <div className="blog-details__content">
                  <p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO), in collaboration with the International
                    Electrotechnical Commission(IEC), has developed ISO-27001, the leading international standard

                <h4>What is ISMS?</h4>
                <div className="blog-details__content">
                  <p>An ISMS is a set of policies and procedures established to manage sensitive data within
                    a company. The organization is vulnerable to cyberattacks and data breaches in the absence
                    of an ISMS. This system is therefore an essential component of an organization.
