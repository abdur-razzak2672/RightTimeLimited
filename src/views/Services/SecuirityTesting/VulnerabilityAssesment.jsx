                  We have first-hand experience at working with penetration testing providers who charge high-rates for their services only to provide a re-branded vulnerability scan report, often only telling you things you already know and/or a range of false positives that you then need to verify. Further, and especially when it comes to application security testing, we are painfully aware of the number of penetration testers who do not understand how applications are designed or built, leading to less thorough application security tests.

                  At CCS we take great pride in our high-quality penetration testing, security assessment, and vulnerability scanning services. Our testers are experts in their respective fields, in particular, our application security testers have a deep understanding of software engineering and architecture, prior to becoming security experts. Indeed, they have typically been involved in the architecture and development of enterprise class systems, including application-layer security systems as well.

In the next phase, Manual Verification, AT&T Cybersecurity Consulting manually validates the results of the automated tools. Next is the Vulnerability Exploitation phase in which exploits are attempted against the identified vulnerabilities. In the final phase of Analysis and Reporting, the findings are analyzed and documented.
